# Psychic-Game

This is a game of chance and probability.
The user selects a letter out of the alphabet and types it (no where specific on the page just types the letter once on the page)
The Wins/Loses will then go up or stay at 0 until the user either wins or loses. 
There are 15 tries to Win the game which is displayed on the page. 
The page also shows what letters the user has guessed so they can move on to another letter to see if that is the letter being guessed.
